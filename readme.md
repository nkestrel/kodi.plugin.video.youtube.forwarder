## Youtube Forwarder
Kodi/XBMC plugin

Takes the place of TheCollective's Youtube plugin (plugin.video.youtube) and forwards video play requests to a different plugin. This is done by using the same ID and a large version number so it takes precedence and is not overwritten by an update.

There is no need to overwrite the existing Youtube plugin, this plugin's higher version number will ensure it takes precedence. Installing from the ZIP file will place it in the folder plugin.video.youtube.forwarder. Delete this folder to uninstall and the original Youtube plugin will become available again.
